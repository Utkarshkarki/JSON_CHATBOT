# JSON_CHATBOT
Creating chatbot with json file
The Core Concept: A Conversational Flowchart
Think of your JSON file as a flowchart or a "choose your own adventure" story.

states: These are the specific points or "pages" in the conversation. For example, welcome, handle_support, or ask_for_feedback.

transitions: These are the paths or choices that lead from one state to another. The chatbot takes a path based on a condition, which in your case is the user's intent.

To build a chatbot, you need an "engine" that reads this map, keeps track of where the user is, understands their intent, and follows the paths.

How to Build the Chatbot Engine
Here is a step-by-step guide to building the logic for your chatbot, along with a simple Python example to illustrate the concept.

Step 1: Create a Workflow Engine
The engine's job is to load your JSON file and manage the conversation's state. It will:

Load the workflow from the JSON file.

Keep track of the current_state for a user.

Use the user's input to find the correct transition to the next_state.

Step 2: Implement Intent Classification
Your transitions depend on classifying the user's intent (e.g., support, feedback, fallback). You need a function that takes the user's text and returns one of these intents.

Simple Method: For starting out, you can use simple keyword matching. For example, if the input contains "help" or "broken", the intent is support.

Advanced Method: Use a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) service or library (like Dialogflow, Rasa NLU, or even another LLM call) for more accurate classification.

Step 3: Handle State Actions
When the chatbot enters a new state, it needs to perform an action. Based on your JSON, the main action is calling a Large Language Model (LLM).

Your engine will look at the current state's type. If it's llm, it will:

Get the prompt template from the state's definition.

Replace any placeholders (like {{user_input}}) with the actual user message.

Send this formatted prompt to an LLM (like the Gemini API, OpenAI's API, etc.).

Return the LLM's response to the user.


This code provides the fundamental logic. To turn it into a full-fledged application, you would need to:

Integrate a real LLM API in the call_llm function.

Build a better intent classifier in the classify_intent function.

Manage user sessions so you can handle multiple conversations at once, each with its own current_state.
